## Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase -- do not invent new abstractions
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Run the typecheck command before considering any change complete
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the "why"
- Never leave TODO comments without implementing the code
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task at hand
