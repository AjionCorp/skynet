# Current Task
## [TEST] Add watchdog regression for reconciliation-before-fixer ordering in both normal and one-shot cycles — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert the reconcile/supersede pass runs before every fixer dispatch decision and logs exactly one deterministic before/after active-root counter pair per cycle. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
