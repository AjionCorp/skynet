# Current Task
## [INFRA] Add watchdog hash-drift pressure alerting with throttle guard — when failed-root parity reports `hash_match=false` for consecutive cycles, emit one throttled high-severity event with both hashes and root counters, then suppress repeats until cooldown or convergence. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #4 operational awareness.
