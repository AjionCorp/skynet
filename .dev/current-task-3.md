# Current Task
## [TEST] Add regression fixture for backlog ordering recovery with misplaced checked rows — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, feed a backlog where `[x]` rows precede claimed rows and assert output ordering is exactly `[>]` then `[ ]` then `[x]` with claimed lines unchanged. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic behavior.
