# Current Task
## [TEST] Add lock-compat regression coverage for CLI helper DRY root — extend CLI command tests to prove shared `isProcessRunning` handles both directory locks and file locks identically to prior behavior, and that `readFile` fallback semantics remain unchanged. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic behavior.
