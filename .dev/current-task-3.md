# Current Task
## [INFRA] Prevent project-driver re-queue variants for known failed roots — in `scripts/project-driver.sh` prompt and generated-task postfilter, reject new tasks whose normalized title matches existing canonical roots in `.dev/failed-tasks.md` unless the task is an explicit continuation of that root. Mission: Criterion #3 convergent planning and Criterion #2 retry-loop reduction.
