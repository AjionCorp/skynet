# Current Task
## [TEST] Add shell regression for watchdog convergence snapshot event shape — in shell tests for `scripts/watchdog.sh`, verify `failed_root_snapshot` emits once per cycle with expected counters and that preserved `fixing-*` rows do not inflate duplicate counts. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
