# Current Task
## [TEST] Add regression coverage for shared failed-task field codec round-trip invariants — in shell tests for failed-task parsing/writes, feed adversarial strings (embedded `|`, escaped pipes, markdown punctuation, multi-space/newline variants) through the shared codec and assert parse-stable round trips plus unchanged active-root counting semantics. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent parsing.
