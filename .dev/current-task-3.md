# Current Task
## [NMI] Publish canonical diagnostics only for truly remaining active roots after cleanup — if any `status=blocked|pending` roots remain, capture latest exact `pnpm typecheck` diagnostics from `.dev/scripts/dev-worker-*.log` and `.dev/scripts/task-fixer-*.log`, then keep one canonical follow-up per unresolved root. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 operator trust.
