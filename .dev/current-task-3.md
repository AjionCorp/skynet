# Current Task
## [DATA] Read watchdog reconciliation counters from snapshot in dashboard status handler — update `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-status.ts` to consume `.dev/watchdog-telemetry.json` as the primary source for reconciliation counters (including blocked-duplication fields) with a safe fallback to current behavior when the snapshot is missing. Mission: Criterion #4 telemetry trust and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
