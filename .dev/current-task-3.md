# Current Task
## [TEST] Add watchdog regression for active-root precedence and tie-break determinism — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, include fixtures where the same normalized root appears as `fixing-*`, `blocked`, and `pending`; assert canonical row selection follows precedence, unaffected rows are byte-identical, and second identical run is no-op. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent state.
