# Current Task
## [DOCS] Update README CLI reference with run, watch, upgrade, and metrics commands — FRESH implementation (delete stale branch `dev/update-readme-cli-reference-with-upgrade` first). In `README.md`, add 4 rows to the CLI Reference table: `run` ("Execute a one-shot task without adding to backlog"), `watch` ("Real-time terminal dashboard with 3s refresh"), `upgrade` ("Check for and install latest CLI version"), `metrics` ("Display pipeline performance analytics"). Update the "How It Works" section reference from "up to 2" dev-workers to "up to 4" (matching SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS=4). No other files need changes. Criterion #1
