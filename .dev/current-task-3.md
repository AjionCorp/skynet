# Current Task
## [FIX] Land canonical pipeline-logs line-count optimization with strict response parity — in `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-logs.ts` and handler tests, keep buffer newline counting while preserving empty-file/no-trailing-newline response shape and typecheck. Mission: Criterion #3 runtime efficiency and Criterion #2 reliable gates.
