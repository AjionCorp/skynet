# Current Task
## [FIX] Enforce duplicate-pending prevention at write-time in `task-fixer.sh` — before append to `.dev/failed-tasks.md`, update attempts/error on normalized pending match instead of inserting a new row; verify behavior with repeated retries on same task title/branch. Mission: Criterion #3 clean state and fixer efficiency.
