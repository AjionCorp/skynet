# Current Task
## [TEST] Add shell regression coverage for malformed failed-task row handling — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh` and/or shared parser tests, inject adversarial rows with extra `|` delimiters in task/error text and assert reconciliation keeps one canonical active root per valid row, skips/repairs malformed rows deterministically, and never mutates unaffected rows. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic parsing.
