# Current Task
## [INFRA] Add watchdog guardrail to suppress no-op blockers rewrites when active-root hash is unchanged — skip `.dev/blockers.md` Active rewrites and emit a deterministic `blockers_sync_skipped` event when canonical active-root hash has not changed, reducing state churn between cycles. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic state and Criterion #4 operational clarity.
