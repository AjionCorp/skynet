## [INFRA] Reconcile blocked/pending drift between failed-task and backlog state after fixer cycles — add a watchdog post-cycle reconciliation report (`active_roots`, `duplicate_active_rows`, `superseded_rows`) and emit events for every superseded duplicate. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop stability and Criterion #4 visibility.
