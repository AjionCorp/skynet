# Current Task
## [TEST] Add project-driver regression for backlog ordering sanitizer — feed mixed-order backlog fixtures and assert claimed rows are preserved verbatim at top, unchecked rows remain intact, and checked history is only moved downward. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic behavior.
