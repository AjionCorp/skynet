# Current Task
## [INFRA] Execute one canonical failed-task cleanup pass after reconciliation — run one scripted sweep over `.dev/failed-tasks.md` to collapse duplicate `pending` rows by normalized title+branch, supersede already-completed retries, and log before/after counts. Mission: Criterion #2 loop efficiency and Criterion #3 convergent state.
