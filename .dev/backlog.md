# Backlog

<!-- Priority: top = highest. Format: - [ ] [TAG] Task title — description -->
<!-- Markers: [ ] = pending, [>] = claimed by worker, [x] = done -->

- [x] [INFRA] Enforce per-cycle failed-task reconciliation before any fixer dispatch path — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, guarantee reconciliation/supersede runs in normal and one-shot cycles before fixer launch, and emit one deterministic before/after active-root counter log each cycle. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [FIX] Make failed-task markdown row writes pipe-safe across writers — in `scripts/task-fixer.sh` and any shared failed-task write helpers, escape or encode literal `|` in task/error/branch fields so `.dev/failed-tasks.md` remains parse-stable and row corruption cannot create phantom duplicates. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic state and Criterion #2 retry-loop reliability.
- [x] [TEST] Add shell regression for failed-task table serialization/parsing invariants — add tests covering rows with embedded `|`, long error strings, and repeated retries; assert canonical parser still counts `pending|blocked|fixing-*` correctly and reconciliation supersedes duplicates deterministically. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
- [x] [NMI] Publish canonical diagnostics only for truly remaining active roots after cleanup — if any `status=blocked|pending` roots remain, capture latest exact `pnpm typecheck` diagnostics from `.dev/scripts/dev-worker-*.log` and `.dev/scripts/task-fixer-*.log`, keep one canonical follow-up task per root, and supersede duplicate variants. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 trustworthy telemetry. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for reconciliation-before-fixer ordering in both normal and one-shot cycles — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert the reconcile/supersede pass runs before every fixer dispatch decision and logs exactly one deterministic before/after active-root counter pair per cycle. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
- [ ] [INFRA] Centralize failed-task markdown escaping/unescaping into shared helpers and migrate all writers/parsers — add shared shell helpers in `scripts/_config.sh` (or sourced helper) so `task-fixer.sh` and `watchdog.sh` use one canonical encode/decode path for `|`, backticks, and newlines in table fields. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic state and Criterion #2 retry-loop stability.
- [ ] [TEST] Add regression coverage for shared failed-task field codec round-trip invariants — feed adversarial task/error strings (embedded `|`, escaped pipes, markdown punctuation, multi-space) through the shared codec and assert parse-stable round-trips plus unchanged active-root counting semantics. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent parsing.
- [ ] [INFRA] Add stale-claimed backlog recovery sweep tied to live lock/worktree state — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, detect `[>]` rows with no corresponding active lock/heartbeat/worktree and atomically demote them back to `[ ]` to prevent permanent claimed starvation. Mission: Criterion #3 no-task-loss guarantees and Criterion #2 throughput.
- [ ] [TEST] Add shell regression for stale-claimed demotion safety rules — assert only truly orphaned claimed rows are demoted, active claimed rows are preserved byte-for-byte, and post-sweep backlog ordering remains `[>]` then `[ ]` then `[x]`. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic planning.
- [ ] [DATA] Emit canonical `failed_root_snapshot` and blockers-sync parity check after reconciliation — extend watchdog telemetry to include a checksum/hash of active normalized roots and verify `.dev/blockers.md` Active reflects the same root set; emit mismatch event when drift is detected. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
# Recent checked history (last 30)
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression coverage for stale blocked-root supersede with duplicates — in shell tests for `scripts/watchdog.sh`, feed fixtures containing duplicate `blocked|pending` rows for roots already in `.dev/completed.md` and assert exactly one canonical active row remains, unaffected `fixing-*` rows are preserved, and ordering is deterministic. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
- [x] [INFRA] Run one canonical stale-active supersede sweep for failed-task roots already merged to `main` — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, ensure `_auto_supersede_completed_tasks()` demotes stale `status=blocked|pending` rows when normalized titles match `.dev/completed.md`, preserve any `fixing-*` rows, and emit `task_superseded` per transition. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [DATA] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active from reconciled failed-root reality — rebuild Active entries from current `.dev/failed-tasks.md` after cleanup so there is exactly one bullet per true open root, remove stale duplicate-root bullets, and keep Celebration/Resolved sections intact. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [TEST] Add project-driver regression for backlog ordering sanitizer — feed mixed-order backlog fixtures and assert claimed rows are preserved verbatim at top, unchecked rows remain intact, and checked history is only moved downward.

Mission: Criterion #2 planning throughput and Criterion #3 deterministic state management.
- [x] [TEST] Add project-driver regression for backlog history rotation invariants — in shell tests for `scripts/project-driver.sh`, verify rotation never reorders or rewrites leading claimed `[>]` rows and never removes unchecked `[ ]` tasks while archiving only older `[x]` history entries.

- [x] [INFRA] Enforce canonical backlog ordering in project-driver post-generation sanitizer — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, normalize output so all `[>]` rows stay first, followed by `[ ]` rows, with all `[x]` rows strictly in bottom history; preserve claimed lines byte-for-byte.

- [x] [INFRA] Add a watchdog guard to auto-supersede stale `pending` rows already completed by canonical root — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, compare normalized failed-task roots to `.dev/completed.md` and mark stale retries `superseded` in one pass without touching active fixer rows. Mission: Criterion #2 loop efficiency and Criterion #3 wasted-cycle elimination.

- [x] [INFRA] Harden project-driver generation filter against retry-root duplication — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, reject new unchecked tasks whose normalized title matches any active failed-task root (including `fixing-*`), log each skip, and keep unchecked backlog count <= 15. Mission: Criterion #3 convergent planning and Criterion #2 retry-loop stability.
- [x] [INFRA] Collapse canonical duplicate `pending` retry rows for the CLI helper DRY root — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, when multiple `pending` rows normalize to `close blocked cli helper dry root for readfile isprocessrunning`, keep one canonical active row, mark the rest `superseded`, and emit per-row `task_superseded` events without modifying active `fixing-*` rows.
