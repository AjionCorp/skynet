# Backlog

<!-- Priority: top = highest. Format: - [ ] [TAG] Task title — description -->
<!-- Markers: [ ] = pending, [>] = claimed by worker, [x] = done -->

- [x] [FIX] Close blocked config parity root for watchdog/one-shot knobs — align `templates/skynet.config.sh` and `packages/cli/src/commands/config.ts` so `SKYNET_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL`, `SKYNET_ONE_SHOT`, and `SKYNET_ONE_SHOT_TASK` defaults/descriptions stay synchronized and verified by tests. Mission: Criterion #1 discoverability and Criterion #3 deterministic config behavior.
- [ ] [FIX] Unblock Codex large-prompt reliability root with stdin-first invariants — in `scripts/agents/codex.sh` and shell tests, enforce prompt-via-stdin path, preserve child exit codes, and keep >300KB prompt regression coverage passing. Mission: Criterion #6 multi-agent compatibility and Criterion #2 self-correction closure.
- [x] [NMI] Publish canonical diagnostics only for truly remaining active roots after cleanup — if any `status=blocked|pending` roots remain, capture latest exact `pnpm typecheck` diagnostics from `.dev/scripts/dev-worker-*.log` and `.dev/scripts/task-fixer-*.log`, then keep one canonical follow-up per unresolved root. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 operator trust. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [INFRA] Run one canonical stale-active supersede sweep for blocked/pending rows already fixed — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, supersede any `status=blocked|pending` rows in `.dev/failed-tasks.md` whose normalized root maps to `.dev/completed.md`, preserving all `fixing-*` rows byte-for-byte and emitting before/after root counters. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [ ] [INFRA] Canonicalize active failed roots to one row per normalized root in watchdog — extend reconciliation in `scripts/watchdog.sh` to keep exactly one active row per normalized root (`pending|blocked|fixing-*`), supersede duplicate variants, and emit deterministic per-root reconciliation metrics/events. Mission: Criterion #2 throughput and Criterion #3 deterministic state.
- [ ] [TEST] Re-open CLI operational E2E smoke coverage as one canonical root — in `tests/e2e/cli-commands.test.sh`, add deterministic checks for `skynet stop`, `pause/resume`, `completions bash`, and `validate`, ensuring no worker-count hardcoding regressions and `pnpm typecheck` stays green. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #1 safe adoption.
- [ ] [DATA] Surface failed-root convergence metrics in CLI `status --json` — in `packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts`, add `activeRoots`, `duplicateActiveRows`, and `blockedRoots` using the same normalized-root parser semantics as dashboard/watchdog. Mission: Criterion #4 full visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [ ] [INFRA] Add failed-task history rotation guardrail to bound fixer context size — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, archive older `fixed|superseded` rows from `.dev/failed-tasks.md` into `.dev/failed-tasks-archive.md` after a configurable cap while preserving active row ordering. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop throughput and Criterion #3 deterministic state management.
- [ ] [TEST] Add shell regression for reconcile-only idempotence with snapshot invariants — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert reconcile-only mode dispatches nothing, preserves `fixing-*` rows exactly, emits one `failed_root_snapshot`, and performs no changes on a second identical pass. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent recovery.
- [ ] [TEST] Add shell regression for auth-gate dispatch suppression lifecycle — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, simulate failed agent auth checks to assert dispatch suppression, then restore auth and assert exactly one recovery event with next-cycle dispatch resumption. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.

# Recent checked history (last 30)
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for blocked-row supersede guardrails — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert completed-root supersede touches only stale `blocked|pending` rows, never rewrites `fixing-*` rows, and preserves unaffected active-row ordering. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
- [x] [TEST] Add project-driver regression to suppress task generation for stale-active completed roots — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, verify unchecked generation skips roots detected as stale-active (present as `blocked|pending` in failed-tasks but already completed) until watchdog supersedes them. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent planning.
- [x] [INFRA] Enforce canonical backlog marker ordering before each dispatch cycle — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` (or shared `_config.sh` helper), run a pre-cycle sanitizer that guarantees all `[>]` rows stay first, `[ ]` rows follow, and any misplaced top-level `[x]` rows are moved into checked history without rewriting claimed lines byte-for-byte. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic planning state and Criterion #2 no-task-loss reliability.
- [x] [INFRA] Add agent-auth preflight gate before watchdog dispatch to avoid dead cycles when credentials expire — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` plus shared auth helpers (`scripts/auth-check.sh`/`scripts/_agent.sh`), detect unauthenticated Claude/Codex sessions before dispatch, emit one throttled `agent_auth_required` event, and skip new claims until auth is restored. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction continuity and Criterion #3 no-task-loss reliability.
- [x] [TEST] Add shell regression for auth-expiry dispatch suppression and recovery — in watchdog tests, simulate failed auth checks and assert no new claims/dispatches occur, then restore auth and assert dispatch resumes in the next cycle with a single recovery event. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [INFRA] Add watchdog guardrail to suppress no-op blockers rewrites when active-root hash is unchanged — skip `.dev/blockers.md` Active rewrites and emit a deterministic `blockers_sync_skipped` event when canonical active-root hash has not changed, reducing state churn between cycles. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic state and Criterion #4 operational clarity.
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for no-op blockers sync guardrail semantics — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert unchanged active-root hash emits exactly one `blockers_sync_skipped` event, does not rewrite `.dev/blockers.md`, and preserves Active/Resolved/Celebration content byte-for-byte. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #4 operational trust.
- [x] [INFRA] Run one canonical stale-active root supersede sweep for current blocked/pending drift — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, reconcile `.dev/failed-tasks.md` so stale `status=blocked|pending` rows that map to `.dev/completed.md` are superseded in one pass (without touching `fixing-*` rows), and emit deterministic before/after root counters. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [DATA] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active from post-reconciliation canonical failed roots — rebuild Active entries from current `.dev/failed-tasks.md` so exactly one bullet remains per true open root and stale duplicate-root bullets are removed while preserving Celebration/Resolved sections. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [INFRA] Add duplicate-active-root pressure alerting in watchdog with throttle guard — when `duplicate_active_rows > 0` across consecutive cycles, emit a single throttled high-severity event/notification with current root counts and cooldown handling. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 operational awareness.
- [x] [DATA] Surface failed-root hash parity in dashboard pipeline-status output — in `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-status.ts` (and response types), include `activeRootHash`, `blockersActiveHash`, and `hashMatch` using the same normalized-root hashing semantics as watchdog parity checks. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [DATA] Run one canonical reconcile-only convergence sweep and refresh state files — execute watchdog reconcile-only mode to collapse stale active duplicates, then rebuild `.dev/blockers.md` Active from canonical failed roots so parity converges; commit only state-file updates. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [INFRA] Add watchdog hash-drift pressure alerting with throttle guard — when failed-root parity reports `hash_match=false` for consecutive cycles, emit one throttled high-severity event with both hashes and root counters, then suppress repeats until cooldown or convergence. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #4 operational awareness. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [INFRA] Add stale-claimed backlog recovery sweep tied to live lock/worktree state — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, detect `[>]` rows with no corresponding active lock/heartbeat/worktree and atomically demote them back to `[ ]` to prevent permanent claimed starvation. Mission: Criterion #3 no-task-loss guarantees and Criterion #2 throughput.
- [x] [FIX] Restore project-driver backlog ordering convergence when checked rows appear above claims — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, make the rewrite/sanitizer path rebuild from extracted marker rows so `[x]` can never persist above `[>]`, while preserving claimed lines byte-for-byte. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic planning and Criterion #2 loop reliability.
- [x] [TEST] Add regression fixture for backlog ordering recovery with misplaced checked rows — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, feed a backlog where `[x]` rows precede claimed rows and assert output ordering is exactly `[>]` then `[ ]` then `[x]` with claimed lines unchanged. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic behavior.
- [x] [INFRA] Add watchdog `reconcile-only` cycle mode for failed-task convergence and blockers sync — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, add a one-shot path that runs reconciliation/supersede + blockers refresh + snapshot emission without dispatching workers/fixers, logging deterministic before/after counters. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility.
- [x] [TEST] Add shell regression for watchdog reconcile-only mode idempotence — assert reconcile-only performs zero dispatches, preserves active `fixing-*` rows, emits one `failed_root_snapshot`, and is no-op on second run with identical input. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent recovery. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [DATA] Surface failed-root hash parity in CLI `status --json` from canonical files — extend `packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts` to include `activeRootHash`, `blockersActiveHash`, and `hashMatch` using the same normalized-root hashing as watchdog parity checks. Mission: Criterion #4 full visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [TEST] Add CLI status JSON regression for failed-root hash parity fields — in `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/status.test.ts`, assert `activeRootHash`, `blockersActiveHash`, and `hashMatch` are stable for matching vs drifting fixtures. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #4 telemetry trust.
- [x] [INFRA] Enforce per-cycle failed-task reconciliation before any fixer dispatch path — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, guarantee reconciliation/supersede runs in normal and one-shot cycles before fixer launch, and emit one deterministic before/after active-root counter log each cycle. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [FIX] Make failed-task markdown row writes pipe-safe across writers — in `scripts/task-fixer.sh` and any shared failed-task write helpers, escape or encode literal `|` in task/error/branch fields so `.dev/failed-tasks.md` remains parse-stable and row corruption cannot create phantom duplicates. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic state and Criterion #2 retry-loop reliability.
- [x] [TEST] Add shell regression for failed-task table serialization/parsing invariants — add tests covering rows with embedded `|`, long error strings, and repeated retries; assert canonical parser still counts `pending|blocked|fixing-*` correctly and reconciliation supersedes duplicates deterministically. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
