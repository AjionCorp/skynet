# Backlog

<!-- Priority: top = highest. Format: - [ ] [TAG] Task title — description -->
<!-- Markers: [ ] = pending, [>] = claimed by worker, [x] = done -->

- [x] [TEST] Add `status.test.ts` CLI unit test — `status.ts` is the most complex CLI command (400+ lines) with zero dedicated tests. Create `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/status.test.ts`. Mock `fs.readFileSync` for all `.dev/` state files (backlog.md, completed.md, failed-tasks.md, current-task-N.md, worker-N.heartbeat, skynet.config.sh). Test: (a) `--json` flag outputs valid JSON matching `{ project, paused, tasks, workers, healthScore, selfCorrectionRate, missionProgress, lastActivity }` shape, (b) `--quiet` flag outputs only the health score number, (c) health score calculation returns 100 with no failures/blockers/stale heartbeats, (d) health score deductions are correct (5 per pending failure, 10 per blocker, 2 per stale heartbeat), (e) worker heartbeat detection loops through all N workers (not just 2), (f) mission progress parsing shows all 6 criteria. Follow patterns in existing CLI tests (`init.test.ts`, `doctor.test.ts`). Criterion #2
- [x] [DOCS] Add npm package README for @ajioncorp/skynet-cli — create `packages/cli/README.md`. Sections: (1) **One-line description**: "CLI for Skynet — autonomous AI development pipeline". (2) **Installation**: `npm install -g @ajioncorp/skynet-cli`. (3) **Quick Start**: 4 lines — `skynet init --name my-project`, `skynet setup-agents`, `skynet start`, `skynet watch`. (4) **Commands**: table of all 21 commands (init, setup-agents, start, stop, pause, resume, status, doctor, logs, version, add-task, run, dashboard, reset-task, cleanup, watch, upgrade, metrics, export, config) with brief one-line descriptions. (5) **Configuration**: key `skynet.config.sh` variables (SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS, SKYNET_STALE_MINUTES, SKYNET_AGENT_PLUGIN, SKYNET_GATE_N). (6) **Dashboard**: `skynet dashboard` launches admin UI on port 3100. (7) **Links**: link to main repo README and CONTRIBUTING.md. Keep under 120 lines. Also add `"README.md"` to the `files` array in `packages/cli/package.json` so it ships with the npm tarball. The npm package currently has NO readme — the npmjs.com page is blank. Criterion #1 (developer experience for npm users)
- [x] [TEST] Add `logs.test.ts`, `start.test.ts`, `stop.test.ts`, and `version.test.ts` CLI unit tests — create 4 test files in `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/`. For `logs.test.ts`: mock `fs.readdirSync` and `fs.readFileSync` for log file listing, test `--tail N` reads last N lines, test `--follow` sets up `fs.watch`, test missing log directory returns helpful message, test `--id` flag selects correct worker log. For `start.test.ts`: mock `child_process.spawn`, test launches watchdog.sh, test detects already-running via PID lock file. For `stop.test.ts`: mock `fs.readFileSync` for PID files, test sends SIGTERM to workers, test handles missing PID files gracefully. For `version.test.ts`: mock package.json read, test outputs version string, mock `execSync` for npm update check, test outdated version suggests upgrade command. Follow existing CLI test patterns in `init.test.ts`. Criterion #2
- [x] [TEST] Add `pause.test.ts`, `resume.test.ts`, `reset-task.test.ts`, and `setup-agents.test.ts` CLI unit tests — create 4 test files in `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/`. For `pause.test.ts`: test creates `.dev/pipeline-paused` sentinel file with correct JSON shape `{ pausedAt, pausedBy }`, test no-op when already paused with appropriate message. For `resume.test.ts`: test removes sentinel file, test no-op when not paused. For `reset-task.test.ts`: test fuzzy-matches task title substring in failed-tasks.md, test resets status to pending and attempts to 0, test updates backlog.md entry from `[x]` to `[ ]`, test `--force` flag deletes stale branch. For `setup-agents.test.ts`: test generates launchd plist files on darwin (mock `process.platform`), test generates crontab entries on linux, test `--uninstall` removes agents, test `--dry-run` shows what would be installed. Mock `fs`, `child_process`, and `process.platform`. Criterion #2
- [x] [INFRA] Add standalone `build` verification job to CI workflow — in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, add a `build` job that runs `pnpm build` to compile all TypeScript packages (admin, dashboard, CLI). Currently `pnpm build` is only run implicitly as part of the `e2e-admin` job, meaning build failures can be masked by earlier job failures. The new job should run after `install` (same pnpm store cache pattern as other jobs). Steps: checkout, setup Node 20, setup pnpm, `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`. This catches TypeScript compilation errors that `pnpm typecheck` might miss (since typecheck doesn't emit files). Criterion #2 (catching build errors before merge)
- [x] [INFRA] Add health score alert notification to watchdog — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, after the crash recovery and stale detection phases, compute a simple health score using the same logic as the pipeline-status handler: start at 100, subtract 5 per pending failed task (grep `status=pending` in failed-tasks.md), subtract 10 per active blocker (count non-empty lines under `## Active` in blockers.md), subtract 2 per stale heartbeat. If score drops below `${SKYNET_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD:-50}`, call `emit_event "health_alert" "Health score: $score"` and `notify_all "Pipeline health alert: score $score/100"`. Use a sentinel file `.dev/health-alert-sent` to prevent repeated alerts — only alert once per drop, delete sentinel when score recovers above threshold. Add `SKYNET_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD="50"` to `templates/skynet.config.sh` with comment. Criterion #3 (proactive failure detection)
- [x] [INFRA] Add project-driver backlog deduplication check — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, after the LLM generates new tasks (the `claude` command output) but before appending them to backlog.md, check each new task line against existing pending `[ ]` and claimed `[>]` entries in the current backlog. Normalize comparison: strip tags (`[FEAT]`, `[FIX]`, etc.), lowercase, remove extra whitespace, take first 60 characters. Skip any new task whose normalized prefix matches an existing entry. Log "Skipped duplicate: <title>" for each skipped task. This prevents the project-driver from regenerating tasks that are already in the backlog or in progress, which wastes worker cycles. Criterion #3 (clean state, no wasted effort)
- [x] [FEAT] Add `skynet doctor --fix` auto-remediation mode — in `packages/cli/src/commands/doctor.ts`, add `--fix` boolean option. When a check fails and has a known remediation: (a) stale heartbeats → delete the stale `.dev/worker-N.heartbeat` file, (b) orphaned worktrees → run `git worktree prune` via `execSync`, (c) orphaned claimed tasks (claimed `[>]` in backlog but no matching worker) → reset from `[>]` to `[ ]` in backlog.md, (d) missing required config vars → append defaults from template. Print "Auto-fixed N issues" summary. Without `--fix`, behavior is unchanged (report only). Register the flag via `.option('--fix', 'Auto-fix issues where possible')`. Criterion #1 (self-healing accessible to users) and #3 (faster recovery)
- [x] [FEAT] Add `skynet import` CLI command for restoring pipeline state from snapshot — create `packages/cli/src/commands/import.ts`. Reads a JSON snapshot file (produced by `skynet export`), validates it has expected keys (backlog.md, completed.md, failed-tasks.md, blockers.md, mission.md, skynet.config.sh), then writes each key's string value back to the corresponding `.dev/` file. Add `--dry-run` flag that shows which files would be overwritten and their size changes without writing. Add `--merge` flag that appends rather than overwrites for .md files. Prompt for confirmation before overwriting (unless `--force` flag). Register in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. Criterion #1 (complete state management lifecycle — export + import)
