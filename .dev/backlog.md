# Backlog

<!-- Priority: top = highest. Format: - [ ] [TAG] Task title — description -->
<!-- Markers: [ ] = pending, [>] = claimed by worker, [x] = done -->

- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression coverage for stale blocked-root supersede with duplicates — in shell tests for `scripts/watchdog.sh`, feed fixtures containing duplicate `blocked|pending` rows for roots already in `.dev/completed.md` and assert exactly one canonical active row remains, unaffected `fixing-*` rows are preserved, and ordering is deterministic. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
- [ ] [DATA] Execute one canonical failed-task cleanup pass and commit resulting state files — run the reconciler so `.dev/failed-tasks.md` no longer lists stale blocked roots already fixed (Codex stdin path, config parity, CLI E2E smoke, pipeline-logs optimization, backlog-parser DRY, CLI helper DRY), keeping only true active roots. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop closure and Criterion #3 state convergence.
- [x] [INFRA] Add watchdog drift metric for stale-active failed rows — emit a per-cycle counter (for example `stale_active_rows`) when an active failed-task row matches completed work, and include it in `failed_root_snapshot` so operators can detect regression immediately. Mission: Criterion #4 real-time visibility and Criterion #3 deterministic self-healing.
- [ ] [DATA] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active from post-cleanup failed-root state — after stale-active cleanup lands, regenerate Active blockers from current `.dev/failed-tasks.md` so exactly one bullet remains per true open root, stale duplicate-root bullets are removed, and Celebration/Resolved sections stay unchanged. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.

# Recent checked history (last 29)
- [x] [INFRA] Run one canonical stale-active supersede sweep for failed-task roots already merged to `main` — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, ensure `_auto_supersede_completed_tasks()` demotes stale `status=blocked|pending` rows when normalized titles match `.dev/completed.md`, preserve any `fixing-*` rows, and emit `task_superseded` per transition. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [DATA] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active from reconciled failed-root reality — rebuild Active entries from current `.dev/failed-tasks.md` after cleanup so there is exactly one bullet per true open root, remove stale duplicate-root bullets, and keep Celebration/Resolved sections intact. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.

Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic behavior.
- [x] [INFRA] Auto-supersede stale `blocked` failed-task rows already closed by canonical completed roots — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, extend `_auto_supersede_completed_tasks()` to evaluate `status=blocked` alongside `pending`, preserve active `fixing-*` rows, and emit `task_superseded` per transitioned row. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for blocked-row supersede guardrails — in shell tests for `scripts/watchdog.sh`, assert completed-root supersede touches only stale `blocked|pending` rows, never rewrites `fixing-*` rows, and preserves unaffected active-row ordering. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery. _(claude failed)_

- [x] [INFRA] Enforce canonical backlog ordering in project-driver post-generation sanitizer — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, normalize output so all `[>]` rows stay first, followed by `[ ]` rows, with all `[x]` rows strictly in bottom history; preserve claimed lines byte-for-byte. Mission: Criterion #2 planning reliability and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [INFRA] Add a watchdog guard to auto-supersede stale `pending` rows already completed by canonical root — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, compare normalized failed-task roots to `.dev/completed.md` and mark stale retries `superseded` in one pass without touching active fixer rows.

- [x] [INFRA] Harden project-driver generation filter against retry-root duplication — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, reject new unchecked tasks whose normalized title matches any active failed-task root (including `fixing-*`), log each skip, and keep unchecked backlog count <= 15. Mission: Criterion #3 convergent planning and Criterion #2 retry-loop stability.
- [x] [INFRA] Collapse canonical duplicate `pending` retry rows for the CLI helper DRY root — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, when multiple `pending` rows normalize to `close blocked cli helper dry root for readfile isprocessrunning`, keep one canonical active row, mark the rest `superseded`, and emit per-row `task_superseded` events without modifying active `fixing-*` rows.

- [x] [INFRA] Emit canonical failed-root convergence snapshot event each watchdog cycle — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, after reconciliation emit one structured `failed_root_snapshot` event with `active_roots`, `duplicate_active_rows`, and `blocked_roots` counts for longitudinal observability. Mission: Criterion #4 real-time visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [TEST] Add shell regression for watchdog convergence snapshot event shape — in shell tests for `scripts/watchdog.sh`, verify `failed_root_snapshot` emits once per cycle with expected counters and that preserved `fixing-*` rows do not inflate duplicate counts.

Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [FIX] Close canonical CLI helper DRY root for `readFile`/`isProcessRunning` without behavior drift — in `packages/cli/src/utils/readFile.ts` and `packages/cli/src/utils/isProcessRunning.ts`, finalize shared helpers, migrate remaining command imports (`doctor.ts`, `status.ts`, `watch.ts`, `start.ts`, `metrics.ts`, `cleanup.ts`), and keep dir-lock/file-lock parity. Mission: Criterion #3 maintainability and Criterion #1 reliability.
