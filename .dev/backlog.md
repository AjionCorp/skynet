<!-- Priority: top = highest. Format: - [ ] [TAG] Task title — description -->
<!-- Markers: [ ] = pending, [>] = claimed by worker, [x] = done -->

- [x] [DATA] Surface `driver_low_fix_rate_mode` counters in status JSON outputs — extend `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-status.ts` and `packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts` to include deterministic low-fix-rate counters (`activated`, `reasonFixRate`, `reasonRetryPressure`, `cappedNewTasks`) sourced from project-driver telemetry so operators can verify pressure behavior. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [ ] [INFRA] Emit canonical project-driver telemetry snapshot per cycle — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, write `.dev/project-driver-telemetry.json` atomically with deterministic fields (`ts`, `pendingBacklog`, `claimedBacklog`, `pendingRetries`, `fixRate`, `duplicateSkipped`, `maxNewTasks`, `driver_low_fix_rate_mode`) so downstream status surfaces can read one stable source of truth. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [ ] [TEST] Add shell regression for project-driver telemetry snapshot determinism — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, assert telemetry JSON is valid, keys are stable, counters match fixture inputs, and identical inputs cause byte-identical output (or an explicit no-rewrite path) across two runs. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic planning behavior.
- [ ] [INFRA] Publish watchdog stale-active supersede skip diagnostics with throttle guards — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, emit deterministic reason codes/counts for rows not superseded (`status_fixing`, `no_completed_match`, `parse_guard`, `already_canonical`) plus bounded row samples so active-state drift can be triaged without log spam. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 operational awareness.
- [ ] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for stale-active skip-diagnostics lifecycle — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, validate skip-reason counters and sampled rows remain deterministic, throttling suppresses duplicate emissions within cooldown, and diagnostics re-arm after convergence changes. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #4 telemetry trust.
- [ ] [INFRA] Centralize failed-root normalization helpers in shared shell config — move duplicated root/title normalization logic from `scripts/project-driver.sh` and `scripts/watchdog.sh` into `scripts/_config.sh` helpers, then migrate callers to one canonical implementation to prevent drift in dedupe/supersede semantics. Mission: Criterion #3 convergent state and Criterion #2 retry-loop reduction.
- [ ] [TEST] Add cross-script regression for shared failed-root normalization parity — extend `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh` and `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh` with the same adversarial title fixtures to prove canonical helpers produce identical normalized roots in dedupe and supersede flows. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.

# Recent checked history (last 30)
- [x] [INFRA] Compact duplicate non-active failed history rows before archive rotation — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, collapse repeated `fixed|superseded` rows with the same normalized root+branch into one canonical history row before moving rows to `.dev/failed-tasks-archive.md`, preserving the newest attempts/error context and emitting deterministic `history_rows_compacted` metrics. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop throughput and Criterion #3 state convergence.
- [x] [TEST] Add regression for failed-task history compaction invariants — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert compaction never touches active rows, preserves markdown table validity, is idempotent across two runs, and keeps archive parity checks stable. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic state management. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [TEST] Add project-driver regression for active-root duplicate suppression counters — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, assert generation skips unchecked candidates when normalized roots are already active in `.dev/failed-tasks.md`, never skips unrelated roots, and emits deterministic `driver_duplicate_root_skipped` totals. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent planning.
- [x] [DATA] Refresh blockers Active from canonical failed roots after stale-active supersede — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` blockers sync path, rebuild `.dev/blockers.md` Active from normalized active failed roots only after the convergence pass and skip file rewrite when active-root hash is unchanged. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [TEST] Add cross-surface parity regression for stale-active counters and root-hash fields — add/extend tests in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-status.test.ts`, and CLI status tests to prove `staleActiveCompletedRows`, `supersededActiveRows`, and root-hash parity fields match semantics across watchdog, dashboard, and `status --json`. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #4 telemetry trust.
- [x] [INFRA] Enforce active-root canonical row precedence (`fixing-*` > `blocked` > `pending`) in watchdog reconciliation — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, when multiple active rows share a normalized root, deterministically keep the highest-priority status row (then latest row index tie-break), supersede lower-priority variants, and emit `canonicalization_precedence_applied` counters. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for active-root precedence and tie-break determinism — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, include fixtures where the same normalized root appears as `fixing-*`, `blocked`, and `pending`; assert canonical row selection follows precedence, unaffected rows are byte-identical, and second identical run is no-op. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [INFRA] Close stale-active failed-root drift in one deterministic watchdog sweep — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, run a canonical active-root convergence pass that supersedes only `status=blocked|pending` rows whose normalized root is already present in `.dev/completed.md`, preserves `fixing-*` rows byte-for-byte, and emits before/after counters plus one stable root-hash summary. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
- [x] [INFRA] Prevent project-driver from generating retry variants for active failed roots — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, normalize unchecked candidate titles against active `pending|blocked|fixing-*` roots in `.dev/failed-tasks.md`, skip generation when a canonical root is already active, and log deterministic `driver_duplicate_root_skipped` counters. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop reduction and Criterion #3 durable root-cause planning.
- [x] [DATA] Surface stale-active convergence counters in status surfaces — add `staleActiveCompletedRows` and `supersededActiveRows` from watchdog reconciliation to `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-status.ts` and CLI `status --json` output, keeping field semantics aligned. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for deterministic stale-active sweep evidence — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, add a fixture with mixed `blocked|pending|fixing-*` rows where only completed-root stale active rows are superseded, unaffected rows remain byte-identical, and emitted counters/hash summary are stable across two identical runs. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery. _(typecheck failed)_
- [x] [TEST] Add watchdog regression for stale blocked/pending supersede guardrails — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, assert completed-root supersede touches only stale `blocked|pending` rows, never rewrites `fixing-*` rows, and preserves unaffected active-row ordering byte-for-byte. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery. _(typecheck failed)_
