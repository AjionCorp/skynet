# Backlog

<!-- Priority: top = highest. Format: - [ ] [TAG] Task title — description -->
<!-- Markers: [ ] = pending, [>] = claimed by worker, [x] = done -->

- [>] [FIX] Remove duplicate `_cleanup_stale_branches` function in watchdog.sh — `scripts/watchdog.sh` defines `_cleanup_stale_branches()` twice: first at line ~435 (handles fixed|superseded|blocked statuses, deletes local+remote branches for all resolved failed tasks) and again at line ~503 (only handles blocked entries with 24h+ age check against blockers.md). The first definition runs at line ~487 and already comprehensively handles ALL resolved statuses including blocked. The second definition at ~503 silently redefines the function, then runs at ~570 doing redundant work (blocked branches were already deleted by the first call). Fix: delete the second function definition — remove the comment block starting with `# --- Stale branch cleanup for permanently failed tasks ---` (line ~500) through the closing brace (line ~567), and delete its invocation `_cleanup_stale_branches` at line ~570. Also remove the `cd "$PROJECT_DIR"` line just before it (line ~569) since it's only needed by the second call. The first, comprehensive version already covers all cases. This is a real bug from two separate tasks being merged independently. Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify no breakage. Criterion #3 (clean code, no redundant logic)
- [x] [FIX] Update config.ts KNOWN_VARS dictionary with missing config variable descriptions — in `packages/cli/src/commands/config.ts`, the `KNOWN_VARS` object (lines 10-53) is missing descriptions for 5 config variables that were added to `templates/skynet.config.sh` after the dictionary was created. Add these entries before the closing brace on line 53: `SKYNET_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: "Max minutes before agent process is killed (default: 45)"`, `SKYNET_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD: "Health score threshold for watchdog alerts (default: 50)"`, `SKYNET_MAX_EVENTS_LOG_KB: "Max events.log size in KB before rotation (default: 1024)"`, `SKYNET_MAX_FIXERS: "Maximum concurrent task-fixer instances (default: 3)"`, `SKYNET_DRIVER_BACKLOG_THRESHOLD: "Pending task count before project-driver generates more (default: 5)"`, `SKYNET_START_DEV_CMD: "Command to start the dev server (optional)"`. This makes `skynet config list` show descriptions for ALL variables instead of blanks for newer ones. Criterion #1 (accurate developer tooling)
- [>] [DOCS] Update README.md and packages/cli/README.md CLI reference tables with missing commands — the main `README.md` CLI Reference table (lines 36-56) lists 19 commands but is missing `export` ("Export pipeline state as a JSON snapshot"), `import` ("Restore pipeline state from an exported snapshot"), and `completions` ("Generate bash or zsh shell completions"). Add rows for all 3 after the `config` row. Also fix `SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS` default from `2` to `4` in the Configuration table (line 91) — this was fixed in `templates/skynet.config.sh` but the README was never updated. In `packages/cli/README.md`, add `import` ("Restore pipeline state from snapshot") and `completions` ("Generate shell completions for bash/zsh") to the Commands table after the `config` row. Update the total command count in any prose that mentions a specific number. Criterion #1 (accurate documentation)
- [>] [TEST] Add `completions.test.ts` CLI unit test — the `completions` command is the newest CLI addition and has zero test coverage. Create `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/completions.test.ts`. Test: (a) bash output contains `complete -W` with all registered command names (init, setup-agents, start, stop, etc.), (b) bash output contains `_skynet()` function definition and `COMPREPLY`, (c) zsh output starts with `#compdef skynet` and contains `_arguments`, (d) zsh output includes all registered commands, (e) invalid shell argument (e.g., "fish") produces error output or exits with non-zero, (f) installation hint is written to stderr. Mock `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write`. Follow patterns in `init.test.ts` and `config.test.ts`. Criterion #2 (complete CLI test coverage — currently 21/23 commands tested)
- [ ] [TEST] Add `test-notify.test.ts` CLI unit test — create `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/test-notify.test.ts`. Mock `child_process.execSync` for notify script execution and `fs.readFileSync` for config parsing. Test: (a) reads `SKYNET_NOTIFY_CHANNELS` from config and identifies enabled channels, (b) executes correct `scripts/notify/<channel>.sh` for each enabled channel, (c) `--channel telegram` tests only the specified channel, (d) reports per-channel OK/FAILED with captured output, (e) handles no configured channels with helpful message ("No notification channels configured"), (f) handles script execution failure (exit code != 0) gracefully with FAILED status. Follow existing CLI test patterns in `init.test.ts`. Criterion #2 (complete CLI test coverage)
- [ ] [TEST] Add `AdminLayout.test.tsx` and `SkynetProvider.test.tsx` component tests — the last 2 untested dashboard components. Create `packages/dashboard/src/components/AdminLayout.test.tsx`: test renders sidebar navigation with all expected links (pipeline, tasks, monitoring, workers, logs, mission, events, settings, prompts, sync), test active link gets highlighted styling via pathname matching, test renders children content area correctly. Create `packages/dashboard/src/components/SkynetProvider.test.tsx`: test provides `apiPrefix` context value to children via `useSkynet()` hook, test default apiPrefix is empty string, test custom apiPrefix is passed through, test children render within provider. Use vitest + @testing-library/react. Follow existing component test patterns in `PipelineDashboard.test.tsx`. Criterion #2 (100% dashboard component test coverage — currently 11/13)
- [ ] [TEST] Add `config-migrate.test.ts` CLI unit test for config migrate subcommand — create `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/config-migrate.test.ts`. Mock `fs.readFileSync` for both template config and user config files. Test: (a) detects missing variables by comparing template vs user config, (b) appends new variables with their default values and preceding comments from template, (c) reports "Added N new config variables: VAR1, VAR2" when variables are missing, (d) reports "Config is up to date" when all variables are present, (e) handles missing template file gracefully, (f) handles missing user config file with helpful error message. Follow existing CLI test patterns. Criterion #2 (test coverage for new config migrate feature)
- [ ] [FEAT] Add `skynet init --from-snapshot` to bootstrap from exported state — in `packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts`, add `--from-snapshot <path>` option via `.option('--from-snapshot <path>', 'Initialize from a previously exported pipeline snapshot')`. When provided, after creating the `.dev/` directory structure and copying scripts (the normal init flow), read the JSON snapshot file (same format as `skynet export` output), validate it has expected keys (backlog.md, completed.md, etc.), and overwrite the default state files with the snapshot's content. Log which files were restored: "Restored N files from snapshot". Skip `skynet.config.sh` from the snapshot (machine-specific paths would be wrong — keep the freshly generated one). This enables duplicating a pipeline setup from one project to another, useful for teams adopting Skynet across multiple repositories. Criterion #1 (faster multi-project adoption)
- [ ] [FEAT] Add `skynet changelog` CLI command for release note generation — create `packages/cli/src/commands/changelog.ts`. Reads `.dev/completed.md`, parses the pipe-delimited table, groups entries by date, organizes by tag ([FEAT] → "Features", [FIX] → "Bug Fixes", [INFRA] → "Infrastructure", [TEST] → "Tests", [DOCS] → "Documentation"). Output format: `## YYYY-MM-DD\n### Features\n- task description\n### Bug Fixes\n- task description\n...`. Default prints to stdout. Add `--output <path>` flag to write to a file. Add `--since <date>` flag to filter entries after a given date (useful for generating notes between releases). Register as `program.command('changelog').description('Generate changelog from completed tasks')` in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. Criterion #5 (measurable mission progress → releasable artifact)

- [x] [TEST] Add `export.test.ts`, `dashboard.test.ts`, and `import.test.ts` CLI unit tests — the last 3 of 21 CLI commands without test coverage. Create in `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/`. For `export.test.ts`: mock `fs.readFileSync` for `.dev/` files, test JSON output contains all expected keys (backlog.md, completed.md, failed-tasks.md, blockers.md, mission.md, skynet.config.sh, events.log), test `--output` flag writes to custom path, test handles missing `.dev/` files gracefully (empty string value). For `dashboard.test.ts`: mock `child_process.spawn`, test launches pnpm dev command with correct `--port` argument, test default port is 3100, test `--port` flag overrides, test opens browser via `open` on macOS / `xdg-open` on Linux (mock `process.platform`). For `import.test.ts`: mock `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.writeFileSync`, test validates snapshot JSON has expected keys, test rejects invalid JSON, test `--dry-run` shows diff without writing, test `--merge` appends to .md files instead of overwriting, test `--force` skips confirmation prompt. Follow patterns in `init.test.ts` and `config.test.ts`. Criterion #2 (100% CLI test coverage)
- [x] [INFRA] Add agent execution timeout to prevent zombie agent processes — in `scripts/_agent.sh`, wrap the agent invocation with a configurable timeout. Add `SKYNET_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES="45"` to `templates/skynet.config.sh`. In the `run_agent()` function (currently in each plugin's `agent_run()`), prefix the agent command with a portable timeout: on Linux use `timeout ${timeout_secs}`, on macOS use `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' ${timeout_secs}` (bash 3.2 compatible, no GNU coreutils dependency). If the agent times out, return exit code 124 (standard timeout convention). In `scripts/dev-worker.sh`, after the agent call (~line 440), detect exit code 124 and log "Agent timed out after ${SKYNET_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES}m" before marking as failed. In `scripts/task-fixer.sh`, apply the same timeout wrapper. This prevents a single hung agent (network issue, infinite loop, LLM API outage) from blocking a worker slot indefinitely. Criterion #3 (no zombie processes)
- [x] [INFRA] Add automatic merge retry with rebase in dev-worker.sh — in `scripts/dev-worker.sh`, when `git merge "$branch_name" --no-edit` fails at line 550, instead of immediately marking the task as failed, attempt recovery: (a) `git merge --abort`, (b) `git pull origin main` to get latest, (c) `git checkout "$branch_name"`, (d) `git rebase main` — if rebase succeeds, checkout main and retry merge. Add a retry counter (max 1 rebase attempt). If rebase itself has conflicts, `git rebase --abort` and proceed to fail the task as before. Log "Merge conflict — attempting rebase recovery..." for visibility. Currently ~15% of task failures are merge conflicts from concurrent workers, all of which go to the task-fixer for a full retry cycle. Inline rebase recovery would resolve most of these in seconds instead of minutes, directly improving throughput and reducing API credit usage. Criterion #2 (self-correction) and #3 (reliability)
- [x] [FEAT] Add shell completions for bash and zsh — create `packages/cli/src/commands/completions.ts`. Register as `program.command('completions').description('Generate shell completions')` with `.argument('<shell>', 'Shell type: bash or zsh')` in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. For bash: output a `complete -W "<all-commands>" skynet` script plus per-command flag completions using `_skynet()` function with `COMPREPLY`. For zsh: output a `#compdef skynet` script using `_arguments` with all 22 commands and their flags. Include all registered commands: init, setup-agents, start, stop, pause, resume, status, doctor, logs, version, add-task, run, dashboard, reset-task, cleanup, watch, upgrade, metrics, export, import, config, completions. Print installation hint to stderr: "# Add to ~/.bashrc: eval \"$(skynet completions bash)\"". Criterion #1 (developer experience — tab completion for 22 commands)
- [x] [FEAT] Add `skynet test-notify` CLI command for notification channel verification — create `packages/cli/src/commands/test-notify.ts`. Read `SKYNET_NOTIFY_CHANNELS` from `.dev/skynet.config.sh` (parse same way as config.ts). For each enabled channel (telegram, slack, discord), execute the corresponding notify script (`scripts/notify/<channel>.sh`) with a test message: "Skynet test notification from <project_name> at <ISO timestamp>". Capture stdout/stderr and report per-channel: "telegram: OK" or "slack: FAILED (connection refused)". Add `--channel <name>` flag to test a single channel. If no channels are configured, print "No notification channels configured. Set SKYNET_NOTIFY_CHANNELS in skynet.config.sh". Register in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. Criterion #1 (verify notification setup before going live)
- [x] [INFRA] Add SSE auto-reconnection with backoff to PipelineDashboard — in `packages/dashboard/src/components/PipelineDashboard.tsx`, the `EventSource` SSE connection has no reconnection handling — if the server restarts or network blips, the dashboard silently stops updating. Add: (a) `onerror` handler that closes the failed connection and schedules a reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s, max 30s), (b) reset backoff timer on successful `onmessage`, (c) add a `connectionStatus` state variable ('connected' | 'reconnecting' | 'disconnected') displayed as a small colored indicator (green/yellow/red dot) next to the page title, (d) handle `document.visibilitychange` — close SSE when tab is hidden, reopen when visible to save server resources. Keep the existing polling fallback intact for browsers that don't support SSE. Criterion #4 (reliable real-time dashboard visibility)
- [x] [FEAT] Add config auto-migration to detect and add new variables on upgrade — in `packages/cli/src/commands/config.ts`, add a `migrate` subcommand: `skynet config migrate`. Reads the installed template (`templates/skynet.config.sh` relative to CLI package) and the user's `.dev/skynet.config.sh`. For each `SKYNET_*` variable defined in the template that is absent from the user's config, append it with its default value and preceding comment (copy the template's comment block). Print "Added N new config variables: VAR1, VAR2, ...". If all variables exist, print "Config is up to date". Also wire this into `packages/cli/src/commands/upgrade.ts` — after a successful npm upgrade, automatically run config migration and report results. This solves the "silent missing config" problem when users upgrade and new config variables (like `SKYNET_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD`, `SKYNET_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`) were added in the newer version. Criterion #1 (smooth upgrade path)
- [x] [TEST] Expand E2E CLI test suite with export/import round-trip and doctor --fix verification — in `tests/e2e/cli-commands.test.sh`, add 3 new test cases after the existing ones: (a) **Export/import round-trip**: run `skynet export --output /tmp/skynet-test-export.json`, verify JSON file exists and contains expected keys, then modify backlog.md (add a test line), run `skynet import /tmp/skynet-test-export.json --force`, verify backlog.md was restored to pre-modification state. (b) **Doctor --fix**: create a stale `.dev/worker-99.heartbeat` file with epoch 0, run `skynet doctor` and verify WARN for stale heartbeat, run `skynet doctor --fix` and verify the stale file was deleted, re-run `skynet doctor` and verify PASS. (c) **Config set/get round-trip**: run `skynet config set SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS 6`, then `skynet config get SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS` and verify output is "6", then restore original value. These are the last untested CLI workflows. Criterion #2 (comprehensive E2E coverage)

- [x] [TEST] Add `status.test.ts` CLI unit test — `status.ts` is the most complex CLI command (400+ lines) with zero dedicated tests. Create `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/status.test.ts`. Mock `fs.readFileSync` for all `.dev/` state files (backlog.md, completed.md, failed-tasks.md, current-task-N.md, worker-N.heartbeat, skynet.config.sh). Test: (a) `--json` flag outputs valid JSON matching `{ project, paused, tasks, workers, healthScore, selfCorrectionRate, missionProgress, lastActivity }` shape, (b) `--quiet` flag outputs only the health score number, (c) health score calculation returns 100 with no failures/blockers/stale heartbeats, (d) health score deductions are correct (5 per pending failure, 10 per blocker, 2 per stale heartbeat), (e) worker heartbeat detection loops through all N workers (not just 2), (f) mission progress parsing shows all 6 criteria. Follow patterns in existing CLI tests (`init.test.ts`, `doctor.test.ts`). Criterion #2
- [x] [DOCS] Add npm package README for @ajioncorp/skynet-cli — create `packages/cli/README.md`. Sections: (1) **One-line description**: "CLI for Skynet — autonomous AI development pipeline". (2) **Installation**: `npm install -g @ajioncorp/skynet-cli`. (3) **Quick Start**: 4 lines — `skynet init --name my-project`, `skynet setup-agents`, `skynet start`, `skynet watch`. (4) **Commands**: table of all 21 commands (init, setup-agents, start, stop, pause, resume, status, doctor, logs, version, add-task, run, dashboard, reset-task, cleanup, watch, upgrade, metrics, export, config) with brief one-line descriptions. (5) **Configuration**: key `skynet.config.sh` variables (SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS, SKYNET_STALE_MINUTES, SKYNET_AGENT_PLUGIN, SKYNET_GATE_N). (6) **Dashboard**: `skynet dashboard` launches admin UI on port 3100. (7) **Links**: link to main repo README and CONTRIBUTING.md. Keep under 120 lines. Also add `"README.md"` to the `files` array in `packages/cli/package.json` so it ships with the npm tarball. The npm package currently has NO readme — the npmjs.com page is blank. Criterion #1 (developer experience for npm users)
- [x] [TEST] Add `logs.test.ts`, `start.test.ts`, `stop.test.ts`, and `version.test.ts` CLI unit tests — create 4 test files in `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/`. For `logs.test.ts`: mock `fs.readdirSync` and `fs.readFileSync` for log file listing, test `--tail N` reads last N lines, test `--follow` sets up `fs.watch`, test missing log directory returns helpful message, test `--id` flag selects correct worker log. For `start.test.ts`: mock `child_process.spawn`, test launches watchdog.sh, test detects already-running via PID lock file. For `stop.test.ts`: mock `fs.readFileSync` for PID files, test sends SIGTERM to workers, test handles missing PID files gracefully. For `version.test.ts`: mock package.json read, test outputs version string, mock `execSync` for npm update check, test outdated version suggests upgrade command. Follow existing CLI test patterns in `init.test.ts`. Criterion #2
- [x] [TEST] Add `pause.test.ts`, `resume.test.ts`, `reset-task.test.ts`, and `setup-agents.test.ts` CLI unit tests — create 4 test files in `packages/cli/src/commands/__tests__/`. For `pause.test.ts`: test creates `.dev/pipeline-paused` sentinel file with correct JSON shape `{ pausedAt, pausedBy }`, test no-op when already paused with appropriate message. For `resume.test.ts`: test removes sentinel file, test no-op when not paused. For `reset-task.test.ts`: test fuzzy-matches task title substring in failed-tasks.md, test resets status to pending and attempts to 0, test updates backlog.md entry from `[x]` to `[ ]`, test `--force` flag deletes stale branch. For `setup-agents.test.ts`: test generates launchd plist files on darwin (mock `process.platform`), test generates crontab entries on linux, test `--uninstall` removes agents, test `--dry-run` shows what would be installed. Mock `fs`, `child_process`, and `process.platform`. Criterion #2
- [x] [INFRA] Add standalone `build` verification job to CI workflow — in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, add a `build` job that runs `pnpm build` to compile all TypeScript packages (admin, dashboard, CLI). Currently `pnpm build` is only run implicitly as part of the `e2e-admin` job, meaning build failures can be masked by earlier job failures. The new job should run after `install` (same pnpm store cache pattern as other jobs). Steps: checkout, setup Node 20, setup pnpm, `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`. This catches TypeScript compilation errors that `pnpm typecheck` might miss (since typecheck doesn't emit files). Criterion #2 (catching build errors before merge)
- [x] [INFRA] Add health score alert notification to watchdog — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, after the crash recovery and stale detection phases, compute a simple health score using the same logic as the pipeline-status handler: start at 100, subtract 5 per pending failed task (grep `status=pending` in failed-tasks.md), subtract 10 per active blocker (count non-empty lines under `## Active` in blockers.md), subtract 2 per stale heartbeat. If score drops below `${SKYNET_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD:-50}`, call `emit_event "health_alert" "Health score: $score"` and `notify_all "Pipeline health alert: score $score/100"`. Use a sentinel file `.dev/health-alert-sent` to prevent repeated alerts — only alert once per drop, delete sentinel when score recovers above threshold. Add `SKYNET_HEALTH_ALERT_THRESHOLD="50"` to `templates/skynet.config.sh` with comment. Criterion #3 (proactive failure detection)
- [x] [INFRA] Add project-driver backlog deduplication check — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, after the LLM generates new tasks (the `claude` command output) but before appending them to backlog.md, check each new task line against existing pending `[ ]` and claimed `[>]` entries in the current backlog. Normalize comparison: strip tags (`[FEAT]`, `[FIX]`, etc.), lowercase, remove extra whitespace, take first 60 characters. Skip any new task whose normalized prefix matches an existing entry. Log "Skipped duplicate: <title>" for each skipped task. This prevents the project-driver from regenerating tasks that are already in the backlog or in progress, which wastes worker cycles. Criterion #3 (clean state, no wasted effort)
- [x] [FEAT] Add `skynet doctor --fix` auto-remediation mode — in `packages/cli/src/commands/doctor.ts`, add `--fix` boolean option. When a check fails and has a known remediation: (a) stale heartbeats → delete the stale `.dev/worker-N.heartbeat` file, (b) orphaned worktrees → run `git worktree prune` via `execSync`, (c) orphaned claimed tasks (claimed `[>]` in backlog but no matching worker) → reset from `[>]` to `[ ]` in backlog.md, (d) missing required config vars → append defaults from template. Print "Auto-fixed N issues" summary. Without `--fix`, behavior is unchanged (report only). Register the flag via `.option('--fix', 'Auto-fix issues where possible')`. Criterion #1 (self-healing accessible to users) and #3 (faster recovery)
- [x] [FEAT] Add `skynet import` CLI command for restoring pipeline state from snapshot — create `packages/cli/src/commands/import.ts`. Reads a JSON snapshot file (produced by `skynet export`), validates it has expected keys (backlog.md, completed.md, failed-tasks.md, blockers.md, mission.md, skynet.config.sh), then writes each key's string value back to the corresponding `.dev/` file. Add `--dry-run` flag that shows which files would be overwritten and their size changes without writing. Add `--merge` flag that appends rather than overwrites for .md files. Prompt for confirmation before overwriting (unless `--force` flag). Register in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. Criterion #1 (complete state management lifecycle — export + import)
