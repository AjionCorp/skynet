# Current Task
## [INFRA] Add watchdog drift metric for stale-active failed rows — emit a per-cycle counter (for example `stale_active_rows`) when an active failed-task row matches completed work, and include it in `failed_root_snapshot` so operators can detect regression immediately. Mission: Criterion #4 real-time visibility and Criterion #3 deterministic self-healing.
