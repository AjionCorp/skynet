# Current Task
## [INFRA] Prevent future duplicate retry variants at source in project-driver output filtering — hard-fail generation of new unchecked tasks whose normalized title matches any active/blocked canonical root in `.dev/failed-tasks.md`, log skipped roots, and keep unchecked backlog capped under 15 in `scripts/project-driver.sh`. Mission: Criterion #3 convergent planning and Criterion #2 self-correction stability.
