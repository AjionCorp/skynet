# Current Task
## [TEST] Add project-driver regression for `fixing-*` retry-root suppression — in `scripts/project-driver.sh` tests, assert new tasks are skipped when normalized titles match active roots in `pending|fixing-*|blocked`, and that skipped roots are logged once per cycle. Mission: Criterion #3 convergent planning and Criterion #2 retry-loop stability.
