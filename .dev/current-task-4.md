# Current Task
## [DATA] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active from reconciled failed-root reality — rebuild Active entries from current `.dev/failed-tasks.md` after cleanup so there is exactly one bullet per true open root, remove stale duplicate-root bullets, and keep Celebration/Resolved sections intact. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
