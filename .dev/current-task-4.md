# Current Task
## [INFRA] Enforce canonical backlog marker ordering in project-driver writes — in `scripts/project-driver.sh` backlog rewrite path, guarantee `[>]` rows remain first (byte-for-byte), `[ ]` rows follow, and top-level `[x]` rows are moved only into checked history section so active work is never buried by history noise. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic planning state and Criterion #2 no-task-loss reliability.
