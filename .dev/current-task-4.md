# Current Task
## [DATA] Emit canonical failed-root snapshot and blockers parity telemetry per reconciliation cycle — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, publish deterministic `activeRootHash`, `blockersActiveHash`, and `hashMatch` payloads from normalized active roots, and emit a mismatch event when blockers drift from failed-root reality. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
