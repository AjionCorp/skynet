# Current Task
## [DATA] Execute one canonical failed-task cleanup pass and commit resulting state files — run the reconciler so `.dev/failed-tasks.md` no longer lists stale blocked roots already fixed (Codex stdin path, config parity, CLI E2E smoke, pipeline-logs optimization, backlog-parser DRY, CLI helper DRY), keeping only true active roots. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop closure and Criterion #3 state convergence.
