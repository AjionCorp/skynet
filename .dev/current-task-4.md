# Current Task
## [TEST] Add watchdog regression for legacy malformed failed-task rows — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, add fixtures with unescaped pipe-expanded rows and escaped-field variants to assert parser guard behavior is deterministic, active-root counting is unchanged for valid rows, and skip diagnostics are emitted with stable reason codes. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic state handling.
