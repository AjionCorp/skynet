# Current Task
## [TEST] Add concurrency regression coverage for failed-task writes — extend shell tests for `scripts/task-fixer.sh` and `scripts/watchdog.sh` to simulate concurrent append/update paths and assert single canonical active row per normalized root after reconciliation. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
