# Current Task
## [TEST] Add project-driver regression for unchecked-cap + ordering invariants — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, fixture backlog with mixed `[>]`, `[ ]`, and misplaced `[x]` rows; assert claimed rows remain byte-identical and first, pending rows are capped at 15, checked history is moved to the bottom, and second identical run is no-op. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent planning behavior.
