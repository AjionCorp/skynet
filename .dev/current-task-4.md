# Current Task
## [INFRA] Add Playwright E2E tests for events, logs, settings, and workers admin pages — in `packages/admin/e2e/`, extend `dashboard.spec.ts` or create `pages.spec.ts`. Add 4 test cases: (a) `/admin/events` page loads and shows events table with timestamp and type columns, (b) `/admin/logs` page loads and shows log type dropdown and monospace content area, (c) `/admin/settings` page loads and shows config key-value table with save button, (d) `/admin/workers` page loads and shows worker scaling controls with +/- buttons. These are the last 4 admin pages without E2E coverage (the other 6 are covered in `admin.spec.ts` and `dashboard.spec.ts`). Criterion #2 (complete admin E2E coverage) and #4 (verified dashboard visibility)
