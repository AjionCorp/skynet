# Current Task
## [NMI] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active from current failed-root reality — rebuild Active blockers from `.dev/failed-tasks.md` rows with `status=blocked` or high-attempt pending roots, attach exact latest diagnostics from `.dev/scripts/dev-worker-*.log` and `.dev/scripts/task-fixer-*.log`, and remove resolved stale root bullets. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility.
