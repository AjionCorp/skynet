# Current Task
## [NMI] Publish canonical diagnostics for any truly remaining active blocked roots post-convergence — after parity sweep completion, capture exact latest `pnpm typecheck` diagnostics from `.dev/scripts/dev-worker-*.log` and `.dev/scripts/task-fixer-*.log`, and keep exactly one follow-up root per unresolved blocker in `.dev/blockers.md`. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility.
