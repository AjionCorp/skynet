# Current Task
## [INFRA] Add backlog-empty recovery generation in `project-driver.sh` — when pending backlog is zero but `.dev/failed-tasks.md` still has `status=pending`, generate recovery tasks and emit `driver_recovery_tasks_generated` instead of idling. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction continuity.
