# Current Task
## [TEST] Add regression coverage for canonicalization invariants across watchdog/task-fixer/project-driver — prove duplicate pending rows are superseded, blocked roots are not re-expanded into variants, and project-driver filters canonical roots against backlog+failed/completed snapshots. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic planning.
