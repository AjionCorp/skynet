# Current Task
## [INFRA] Publish watchdog stale-active supersede skip diagnostics with throttle guards — in `scripts/watchdog.sh` reconciliation, emit deterministic reason codes/counts for rows not superseded (`status_fixing`, `no_completed_match`, `parse_guard`, `already_canonical`) plus bounded row samples so active-state drift can be triaged without log spam. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #4 operational awareness.
