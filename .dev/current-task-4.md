# Current Task
## [TEST] Add project-driver regression to suppress generation for stale-active completed roots — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, verify unchecked generation skips roots present as active `blocked|pending` in `.dev/failed-tasks.md` when that normalized root is already completed, until watchdog supersedes the stale rows. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent planning.
