# Current Task
## [INFRA] Canonicalize active failed roots to one row per normalized root in watchdog — extend reconciliation in `scripts/watchdog.sh` to keep exactly one active row per normalized root (`pending|blocked|fixing-*`), supersede duplicate variants, and emit deterministic per-root reconciliation metrics/events. Mission: Criterion #2 throughput and Criterion #3 deterministic state.
