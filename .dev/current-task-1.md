# Current Task
## [FIX] Close blocked pipeline-logs optimization root with response-shape parity — in `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/pipeline-logs.ts` and related tests, keep buffer-based newline counting while preserving exact empty-file and no-trailing-newline response behavior and passing `pnpm typecheck`. Mission: Criterion #3 runtime efficiency and Criterion #2 reliable gates.
