# Current Task
## [INFRA] Centralize failed-root active-hash computation in one shell helper and reuse it across snapshot + drift alert paths — extract a canonical helper in `scripts/_config.sh` (or sourced helper) and consume it from `scripts/watchdog.sh` so parity and alert logic cannot diverge. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic behavior and Criterion #4 telemetry consistency.
