# Current Task
## [TEST] Re-open CLI operational E2E smoke coverage as one canonical root — in `tests/e2e/cli-commands.test.sh`, add deterministic checks for `skynet stop`, `pause/resume`, `completions bash`, and `validate`, ensuring no worker-count hardcoding regressions and `pnpm typecheck` stays green. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #1 safe adoption.
