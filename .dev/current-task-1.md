# Current Task
## [INFRA] Enforce per-cycle failed-task reconciliation before any fixer dispatch path — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, guarantee reconciliation/supersede runs in normal and one-shot cycles before fixer launch, and emit one deterministic before/after active-root counter log each cycle. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
