# Failed Tasks

| Date | Task | Branch | Error | Attempts | Status |
|------|------|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add `skynet start` and `skynet stop` CLI commands — in packages/cli/src/commands/, `start` launches watchdog.sh as a background process (or loads launchd agents if installed), `stop` kills running workers gracefully via their PID lock files, register both in packages/cli/src/index.ts | merged to main | playwright tests failed | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add crash recovery to watchdog — detect zombie lock files older than SKYNET_STALE_MINUTES, recover from partial task states (unclaim stuck tasks in backlog.md), kill orphan worktree processes, and restart failed workers automatically | merged to main | playwright tests failed (fix attempt 1 failed) | 2 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [INFRA] Add npm package build and publish workflow — add prepublishOnly script to packages/cli/package.json, verify bin field points to compiled output, add GitHub Actions workflow to publish to npm on version tag, test that `npx skynet init` works end-to-end | merged to main | playwright tests failed | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add self-correction metrics tracking — create .dev/metrics.md with auto-fix success rate, track in task-fixer.sh how many failures get auto-resolved vs blocked, expose metrics via new /api/admin/metrics route in packages/admin/src/app/api/admin/metrics/route.ts | dev/add-self-correction-metrics-tracking--cr | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [TEST] Add unit tests for shell script lock acquisition and task claiming — test PID lock, mkdir mutex, stale detection, and concurrent worker scenarios | merged to main | playwright tests failed | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [TEST] Add TypeScript tests for API handlers — test pipeline-status, tasks POST, prompts extraction, monitoring-agents response shapes | merged to main | playwright tests failed | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add mission progress tracking to project-driver — parse mission.md success criteria, track completion percentage, report in dashboard | merged to main | playwright tests failed | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add mission.md viewer tab to admin dashboard — display the current mission with progress indicators next to each success criterion | merged to main | playwright tests failed | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [INFRA] Add CI/CD workflow — GitHub Actions for typecheck, Playwright e2e, and shell script linting on every PR | dev/add-cicd-workflow--github-actions-for-ty | playwright tests failed | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add webhook notification support — Slack and Discord channels alongside Telegram via pluggable _notify.sh | dev/add-webhook-notification-support--slack- | playwright tests failed | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] we need to be able to see in admin for pipeline and monitoring who is active | dev/we-need-to-be-able-to-see-in-admin-for-p | claude exit code 1 | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [TEST] Add integration test for full pipeline task lifecycle — create tests/integration/pipeline-lifecycle.test.sh | dev/add-integration-test-for-full-pipeline-t | claude exit code 1 | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add `skynet logs` CLI command — create packages/cli/src/commands/logs.ts (old spec) | dev/add-skynet-logs-cli-command--create-pack | claude exit code 1 | 0 | superseded |

| 2026-02-19 | [FIX] Fix watchdog hardcoded worker IDs breaking scaling beyond 2 workers | dev/fix-watchdog-hardcoded-worker-ids-breaki | merge conflict | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add multi-project PID isolation validation | dev/add-multi-project-pid-isolation-validati | merge conflict | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [INFRA] Delete stale dev branches and prune worktrees | dev/delete-stale-dev-branches-and-prune-work | merge conflict | 0 | superseded |
| 2026-02-19 | [FIX] Fix watchdog crash_recovery and dispatch hardcoded worker IDs — FRESH implementation (previous branch `dev/fix-watchdog-hardcoded-worker-ids-breaki` has merge conflict — delete it). In `scripts/watchdog.sh`: (1) In `crash_recovery()`, replace `for wid in 1 2` at lines ~115 and ~137 with `for wid in $(seq 1 "${SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS:-2}")`. (2) In Phase 3 orphan worktree cleanup (~line 157), replace the hardcoded `worktree_dirs` array with a dynamic loop building paths for each worker. (3) Replace the hardcoded `w1_running`/`w2_running` variables (~lines 254-262, 350-352) with a dynamic loop checking all workers up to SKYNET_MAX_WORKERS. (4) In the dispatch section, dynamically find idle worker slots instead of only w1/w2. Also verify `validate_backlog()` in `scripts/_config.sh` uses the same dynamic pattern | merged to main | merge conflict | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add mission viewer page to admin dashboard — FRESH implementation (previous branch stale). Create `packages/admin/src/app/admin/mission/page.tsx` that imports a new `MissionDashboard` component from `@ajioncorp/skynet/components`. Create `packages/dashboard/src/components/MissionDashboard.tsx` — fetches pipeline status, renders the raw mission.md content as styled markdown (use a `<pre>` or simple renderer), and below it shows a progress table with green/yellow/red status badges per success criterion from `missionProgress`. Add `MissionDashboard` export to `packages/dashboard/src/components/index.ts`. Add navigation entry in `packages/admin/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`: `{ href: "/admin/mission", label: "Mission", icon: Target }` (import Target from lucide-react). Create API route `packages/admin/src/app/api/admin/mission/route.ts` that reads and returns raw `.dev/mission.md` content | merged to main | merge conflict | 1 | fixed |
| 2026-02-19 | [INFRA] Extend watchdog stale branch cleanup to handle fixed and superseded tasks — the existing `_cleanup_stale_branches()` in `scripts/watchdog.sh` (~line 357) only handles entries with `status=blocked`. Extend it to also delete branches for entries with `status=fixed` (task was retried and merged to main) or `status=superseded` (functionality re-implemented via a different task). Currently there are 16 stale dev/* branches — after this change, the next watchdog run should clean up ~11 of them (those that are fixed/superseded), leaving only branches for actively-worked or pending-retry tasks | dev/extend-watchdog-stale-branch-cleanup-to- | merge conflict | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add `skynet pause` and `skynet resume` CLI commands for pipeline flow control — create `packages/cli/src/commands/pause.ts`: writes a `.dev/pipeline-paused` sentinel file with `{ "pausedAt": "ISO timestamp", "pausedBy": "user" }`. Create `packages/cli/src/commands/resume.ts`: removes the sentinel file. In `scripts/dev-worker.sh`, after PID lock acquisition, check `if [ -f "$DEV_DIR/pipeline-paused" ]; then log "Pipeline paused — exiting"; exit 0; fi`. Same check in `scripts/task-fixer.sh` and `scripts/project-driver.sh`. In `scripts/watchdog.sh`, skip worker dispatch when paused but still run health checks and stale detection. In `packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts`, show "PAUSED" status when sentinel exists. Register both commands in `packages/cli/src/index.ts` | dev/add-skynet-pause-and-skynet-resume-cli-c | merge conflict | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add pipeline event log for audit trail and activity feed — add an `emit_event()` function to `scripts/_config.sh` that appends JSON lines to `.dev/events.log`: `{"ts":"2026-02-19T17:30:00Z","event":"task_claimed","worker":1,"detail":"Add feature X"}`. Call from key points: `dev-worker.sh` (task_claimed, task_completed, task_failed, gate_passed, gate_failed), `task-fixer.sh` (fix_started, fix_succeeded, fix_failed), `watchdog.sh` (worker_killed, stale_detected, branch_cleaned), `project-driver.sh` (backlog_replenished). Create `packages/dashboard/src/handlers/events.ts` that reads last 100 lines from events.log and returns as JSON array. Add `/api/admin/events` route in `packages/admin/src/app/api/admin/events/route.ts`. Add an `ActivityFeed` component to `packages/dashboard/src/components/` showing a scrollable list of recent events with timestamps and colored icons per event type. Add to the pipeline dashboard page | dev/add-pipeline-event-log-for-audit-trail-a | merge conflict | 0 | pending |
