| Date | Task | Branch | Error | Attempts | Status |
|------|------|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add `skynet start` and `skynet stop` CLI commands — in packages/cli/src/commands/, `start` launches watchdog.sh as a background process (or loads launchd agents if installed), `stop` kills running workers gracefully via their PID lock files, register both in packages/cli/src/index.ts | dev/add-skynet-start-and-skynet-stop-cli-com | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add crash recovery to watchdog — detect zombie lock files older than SKYNET_STALE_MINUTES, recover from partial task states (unclaim stuck tasks in backlog.md), kill orphan worktree processes, and restart failed workers automatically | dev/add-crash-recovery-to-watchdog--detect-z | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [INFRA] Add npm package build and publish workflow — add prepublishOnly script to packages/cli/package.json, verify bin field points to compiled output, add GitHub Actions workflow to publish to npm on version tag, test that `npx skynet init` works end-to-end | dev/add-npm-package-build-and-publish-workfl | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [FEAT] Add self-correction metrics tracking — create .dev/metrics.md with auto-fix success rate, track in task-fixer.sh how many failures get auto-resolved vs blocked, expose metrics via new /api/admin/metrics route in packages/admin/src/app/api/admin/metrics/route.ts | dev/add-self-correction-metrics-tracking--cr | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [TEST] Add unit tests for shell script lock acquisition and task claiming — test PID lock, mkdir mutex, stale detection, and concurrent worker scenarios | dev/add-unit-tests-for-shell-script-lock-acq | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
| 2026-02-19 | [TEST] Add TypeScript tests for API handlers — test pipeline-status, tasks POST, prompts extraction, monitoring-agents response shapes | dev/add-typescript-tests-for-api-handlers--t | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |

| 2026-02-19 | [INFRA] Add CI/CD workflow — GitHub Actions for typecheck, Playwright e2e, and shell script linting on every PR | dev/add-cicd-workflow--github-actions-for-ty | playwright tests failed | 0 | pending |
