# Current Task
## [NMI] Produce diagnostics bundle for blocked roots before requeue — for each blocked root cause, capture exact failing file/line/typecheck diagnostics from worker/fixer logs, record minimal repro scope in `.dev/blockers.md` Active, and supersede stale duplicate failed rows for that root. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure.
