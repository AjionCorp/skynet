# Current Task
## [TEST] Add project-driver regression to suppress task generation for stale-active completed roots — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, verify unchecked generation skips roots detected as stale-active (present as `blocked|pending` in failed-tasks but already completed) until watchdog supersedes them. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent planning.
