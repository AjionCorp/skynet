# Current Task
## [INFRA] Add a watchdog guard to auto-supersede stale `pending` rows already completed by canonical root — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, compare normalized failed-task roots to `.dev/completed.md` and mark stale retries `superseded` in one pass without touching active fixer rows. Mission: Criterion #2 loop efficiency and Criterion #3 wasted-cycle elimination.
