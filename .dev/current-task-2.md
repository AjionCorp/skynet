# Current Task
## [INFRA] Run one canonical failed-task compaction sweep for active roots — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, dedupe `pending|superseded` duplicates by normalized root+branch in `.dev/failed-tasks.md`, keep one active row per root, and emit before/after counters. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction throughput and Criterion #3 convergent state.
