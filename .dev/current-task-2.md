# Current Task
## [TEST] Add shell regression for auth-gate dispatch suppression lifecycle — in `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh`, simulate failed agent auth checks to assert dispatch suppression, then restore auth and assert exactly one recovery event with next-cycle dispatch resumption. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
