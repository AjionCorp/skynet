# Current Task
## [TEST] Add project-driver regression for active-root duplicate suppression counters — in `scripts/tests/project-driver.sh`, assert generation skips unchecked candidates when normalized roots are already active in `.dev/failed-tasks.md`, never skips unrelated roots, and emits deterministic `driver_duplicate_root_skipped` totals. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 convergent planning.
