# Current Task
## [TEST] Add watchdog regression for blocked-duplicate compaction determinism — extend `scripts/tests/watchdog.sh` with fixtures containing repeated blocked rows per normalized root; assert one canonical blocked row survives, superseded rows preserve markdown validity/order, counters are stable, and second identical run is a no-op. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic reconciliation.
