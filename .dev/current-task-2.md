# Current Task
## [NMI] Resolve blocked-root state drift between `.dev/backlog.md` and `.dev/failed-tasks.md` — add a watchdog reconciliation pass that supersedes stale blocked/pending duplicates for already-fixed roots and emits before/after root counts, without touching active `fixing-*` rows. Mission: Criterion #2 retry-loop stability and Criterion #3 state convergence.
