# Current Task
## [NMI] Publish canonical blocked-root repro matrix from current logs — regenerate `.dev/blockers.md` Active from `.dev/failed-tasks.md` blocked roots using latest `.dev/scripts/dev-worker-*.log` and `.dev/scripts/task-fixer-*.log` `pnpm typecheck` diagnostics, keeping exactly one root-cause row per canonical title with explicit pass conditions. Mission: Criterion #2 self-correction closure and Criterion #3 convergent state.
