# Current Task
## [INFRA] Refresh `.dev/blockers.md` Active automatically after failed-task reconciliation — in `scripts/watchdog.sh`, add one canonical rebuild step that keeps exactly one Active bullet per active failed root and removes stale duplicate-root bullets without mutating Celebration/Resolved sections. Mission: Criterion #4 trustworthy visibility and Criterion #5 measurable progress.
