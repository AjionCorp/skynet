# Current Task
## [FIX] Unblock Codex large-prompt reliability root (canonical) — in `scripts/agents/codex.sh` and shell regression tests, keep stdin-first prompt delivery, preserve child exit codes through `_agent_exec`, and pass `pnpm typecheck` plus >300KB prompt coverage without spawning new retry variants. Mission: Criterion #6 multi-agent compatibility and Criterion #2 self-correction closure.
