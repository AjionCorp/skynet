# Current Task
## [FIX] Restore project-driver backlog ordering convergence when checked rows appear above claims — in `scripts/project-driver.sh`, make the rewrite/sanitizer path rebuild from extracted marker rows so `[x]` can never persist above `[>]`, while preserving claimed lines byte-for-byte. Mission: Criterion #3 deterministic planning and Criterion #2 loop reliability.
