# Current Task
## [TEST] Add watchdog regression coverage for stale blocked-root supersede with duplicates — in shell tests for `scripts/watchdog.sh`, feed fixtures containing duplicate `blocked|pending` rows for roots already in `.dev/completed.md` and assert exactly one canonical active row remains, unaffected `fixing-*` rows are preserved, and ordering is deterministic. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic recovery.
