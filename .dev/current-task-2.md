# Current Task
## [TEST] Add shell regression for stale-claimed demotion safety rules — assert only truly orphaned claimed rows are demoted, active claimed rows are preserved byte-for-byte, and post-sweep backlog ordering remains `[>]` then `[ ]` then `[x]`. Mission: Criterion #2 quality gates and Criterion #3 deterministic planning.
