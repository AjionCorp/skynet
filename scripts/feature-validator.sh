PROMPT="You are the Feature Validator agent for ${SKYNET_PROJECT_NAME}.

Comprehensive feature tests just ran and some FAILED. Analyze the failures and create fix tasks.

## Test Output
\`\`\`
$test_output
\`\`\`

## Current Backlog
$(cat "$BACKLOG")

## Instructions

1. Read the test output carefully. Identify what broke:
   - Pages that don't load (500 errors, redirects to login, runtime errors)
   - Pages that load but show error states or missing content
   - API endpoints returning wrong data or errors
   - Features that don't work (search, navigation, forms)
   - Detail pages that crash on real data

2. For each genuine failure, investigate the actual code to understand the root cause:
   - Read the page component, API route, and related libs
   - Check for missing Supabase tables, wrong column names, import errors
   - Check for auth/middleware issues causing login redirects

3. Add a task to the backlog at $BACKLOG for each real bug:
   - Use format: \`- [ ] [FIX] Description of what needs fixing\`
   - Be specific: include the URL/endpoint, expected vs actual behavior, root cause
   - Do NOT duplicate tasks already in the backlog
   - Add new tasks near the top (after any existing high-priority items)

4. Do NOT add tasks for tests that passed.
5. Do NOT add more than 5 new tasks per run.
6. If a failure is a test issue (not a real bug), fix the test instead.
7. Write updated files directly — no confirmation needed."
